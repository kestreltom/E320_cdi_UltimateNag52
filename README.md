This is the /mod branch of this repository. This is a repository cloned from: https://github.com/rnd-ash/ultimate-nag52-fw/tree/e88f2b89fd which is a historical repository of: https://github.com/rnd-ash/ultimate-nag52-fw. Three files in the /src directory have been modified in order to better suit the 722.6 transmission on my 2006 E320 cdi. These files are:
pressure_manager.cpp;
profiles.cpp;
torque_convertr.cpp;
If you wish to clone this repository, or do a Git pull be my guest!
If you are cloning into vscode go to branch control and checkout to "mod" or "origin/mod"
you can then build this modified version of the source code and upload the binaries to your tcu
If you want to test the un-modified version, in vscode check out to the "main" branch and build and upload from there.
