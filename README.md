This is the /mod branch of this repository. This is a repository cloned from: https://github.com/rnd-ash/ultimate-nag52-fw/tree/e88f2b89fd which is a historical repository of: https://github.com/rnd-ash/ultimate-nag52-fw. Three files in the /src directory have been modified in order to better suit the 722.6 transmission on my 2006 E320 cdi, giving it a refined but quick shifting high performance feel, something the oem tcu really lacks. All credit ultimately goes to Ashcon Mohseninia who made these tcus, wrote the firmware, and continues to usher this project through countless hours of development... Thank you Ash!
These files are:
pressure_manager.cpp;
profiles.cpp;
torque_convertr.cpp;
If you wish to clone this repository, or do a Git pull be my guest!
If you are cloning into vscode go to branch control and checkout to "mod" or "origin/mod"
you can then build this modified version of the source code and upload the binaries to your tcu. 
If you want to test the un-modified version, in vscode check out to the "main" branch and build and upload from there.
